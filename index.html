	<p style="line-height: 2"; align="justify"; > Vision Photography is an aesthetic brand that predominantly focuses on minimalism. The essence of simplistic, non-belligerent, tranquility style is the prime focus of our work. With arduous contemplation to amalgamate elements into one's work, we also focus on immaculate photography. Furthermore, our work also focuses on the Californian style in which, comprises mixed emotions. Some of the photos’ that are exhibited, can have a wide-variety of styles with ease. Elegance, minimalism, posh are the three salient elements we have integrated as a customary aesthetic and feeling. Some of the works’ may cause one individual to derive a “nostalgia” feeling through the emotions and environment that has been implemented. These works’ hope to deliberately incentivize anyone to start accomplishing what they aspire. With motivation, hard work is at its  presence, thus success is procured. Diverse backgrounds have the aptitude to draw deep connections between the work and the individual simultaneously. Fear is the essence of what is impeding our way to success. We must learn to surmount success, and thus, the works draw a firm theme, conveyed to the audience.  </p>
